- Run MATLAB (for avoiding problems, it should be better to use MATLAB 2010b or later versions)
- Go into the simulation files directory "3DOF_simulator"
- Run init.m
- Open library "m3dof_library.mdl"
- Create a new model and start developing your simulation

N.B.: for running the library functions, your MATLAB shell should always stay into the "3DOF_simulator" directory
For lower versions of MATLAB, it could be possible that for running the simulation you need to configure MATLAB for compilation. In the MATLAB shell type:
mex -setup
